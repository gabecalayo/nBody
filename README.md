N-Body Gravitational Simulation
This project implements a brute-force N-body gravitational simulation in C. The simulation calculates the gravitational interactions between a large number of bodies over several iterations. It is designed to demonstrate the performance improvements achieved by leveraging parallel processing techniques, specifically using MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP.

Project Overview
Serial Implementation: A brute-force approach that calculates the gravitational forces between all pairs of bodies. This implementation serves as a baseline for performance comparison.
MPI Parallelization: The simulation is parallelized using MPI, enabling distributed processing across multiple ranks. This approach significantly reduces runtime by dividing the workload among processes.
OpenMP Optimization: Additionally, the simulation can be parallelized using OpenMP for shared-memory systems, offering further performance enhancements on multi-core CPUs.
Features
Serial Simulation: Computes gravitational interactions for a given number of bodies using a nested loop, resulting in O(nÂ²) complexity.
MPI Parallelization: Distributes the computational workload across multiple processes, reducing runtime and increasing the number of interactions per second.
OpenMP Parallelization: Optimizes the simulation for multi-core processors, improving performance on shared-memory systems.
Performance Metrics: Measures and reports runtime and interactions per second for different implementations, allowing for detailed performance analysis.
